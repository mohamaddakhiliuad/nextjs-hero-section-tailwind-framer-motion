## 🚀 Why this matters

After years of working in development and digital branding, I realized how hard it is to find **real-world code samples** that are:

- ✅ **Well-structured** but not overengineered
- ✅ **Beginner-friendly** but based on best practices
- ✅ **Re-usable** in real production environments

So I started sharing parts of my actual projects—cleaned up and focused on learning and reusability.
